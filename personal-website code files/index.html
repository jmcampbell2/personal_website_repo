            <h2>A little bit about me:</h2>
            <div class="half-width">
              <p>I've made my home base in the Greater Philadelphia area since graduating from Haverford College in 2011. My journey into tech started with a degree in Astrophysics. As I worked in the business world, I came to realize that my interests lay in improving business operations and projects using many of the same skills I practiced in science.  As I started to explore analytical techniques, coding and programming languages, I was hooked. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="half-width">
              <p>That curiosity then opened a door that could never be shut. When I learned how to build my own code procedures, I realized I had found my opportunity to pivot my career. I have since continued on that path of learning, starting with webdesign and moving on to statistical analysis in R, as well as other realted skills, to further my aspirations of working in data science. Now I'm making the full switch to data analytics, where I can use my science background, organizational skills, and eye for detail to write clean, elegant, and effective code.</p>

              <h3>Hand-Coded R</h3>
              <p>My focus is writing clean, well-formatted, semantic scripts to make sure that the content is easy to read, easy to collaborate, trouble-shoot and accessible. I like coding in R because it is open-source and has many versatile packages to work with, including those for collecting and cleaning data, exploring and visualizing data, and producing documentation.</p>

              <h3>Turning Raw Data into Insights</h3>
              <p>You can trust me to take unorganized data and effectively convert it into tidy, ready-to-analyze form, complete with documentation & descriptive statistics.  Tidy and documented data are essential for accurately analyzing and communicating reproducible research.</p>

              <h3>Well-Organized Analysis</h3>
              <p>I pride myself on writing analytic programs that are easy to read and build on. I focus on keeping my R and R Markdown clean and fast to read, and I make it a habit to stay up to date on current best practices. Presenting concise findings and visualizations are the best way to communicate results in our busy world.</p>

              <h3>Ballroom Dance</h3>
              <p>I am passionately pursuing ballroom dancing, which I perform and compete in a few times a year. The mental and physical challanges push me to learn and grow into not just a better dancer, but a better individual. </p>
